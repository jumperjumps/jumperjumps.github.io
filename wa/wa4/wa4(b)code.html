        <p>This interactive generative art piece was created using JavaScript and demonstrates proficiency in writing clean, well-structured code while exploring creative interaction. The project highlights the ability to design engaging, responsive visuals through code, balancing technical execution with artistic expression. The code is clearly organized and documented, allowing viewers to easily understand and apply the techniques to their own projects.
        A primary challenge of this project was developing a visual identity independent of the existing real-world company. This required creating a design aesthetic from the ground up, as well as designing an effective layout capable of organizing a large amount of information in a clear manner.</p>
