        <h2>Colorado Symphony Classics</h2>
        <p>Demonstrates advanced proficiency in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign through thoughtful layout, typography, and visual hierarchy.<br>

        The front of the poster establishes an elegant design approach, that the viewers are able to understand and get the sense of sophistication.<br>

        The back layout accommodates all required information while maintaining the elegant visual. Strategic use of typographic hierarchy, spacing, and alignment is demonstrated.<br>

        A primary challenge of this project was developing a visual identity independent of the existing real-world company. This required creating a design aesthetic from the ground up, as well as designing an effective layout capable of organizing a large amount of information in a clear manner.</p>

        <h2>Lordess Leaves</h2>
        <p>This project showcases a multidisciplinary design skill set by taking an original concept from the original idea to full brand realization. The work demonstrates the ability to develop a cohesive visual identity—including the look, feel, logo, and brand mission—while ensuring all elements flow as a unified visual rather than separate components.<br>

        The project includes the development of a tea tin product, including logo design, branding, packaging, and product identity. The logo was hand-designed in Procreate, showing dedication to originality. The product was 3D rendered in Adobe Substance 3D Stager to create a realistic mock up, and Adobe Illustrator was used to create layouts and present the product in a polished, professional format.<br>

        This project showcases many different expertise. It demonstrates the ability to come up with an original idea and bring it to life by designing a look, logo, feel, and brand with a mission. There is attention to creating a cohesive brand and product that feels like one making it more pleasing to the consumers.
